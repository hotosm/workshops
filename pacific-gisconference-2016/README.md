# OpenStreetMap at the Pacific GIS Conference 2016
## Fundamentals of remote and field mapping

Bula! On December 2, 2016 HOTOSM is organizing an OpenStreetMap (OSM) and field mapping workshop as a part of the Pacific GIS & Remote Sensing Users conference in Suva, Fiji on December 2, 2016. Join us for a half-day of learning about the basics of OSM, remote and field-based mapping in OSM, and tools to use and contribute to OSM. 

OpenStreetMap is a free and open-source map that can be contributed, edited, and used by anyone. If you are an experienced contributor or have never heard about OSM, come join and learn how to use and contribute to the community. Register for the conference (free registration) at http://gisconference.gsd.spc.int/.
