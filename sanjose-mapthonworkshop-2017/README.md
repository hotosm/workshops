Hola! On May 29, 2017 HOTOSM is organizing an OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapathon workshop at the Universidad de Costa Rica. Join us for a day of learning about the basics of OSM, remote and field-based mapping in OSM, and tools to use and contribute to OSM. 

OpenStreetMap is a free and open-source map that can be contributed, edited, and used by anyone. If you are an experienced contributor or have never heard about OSM, come join and learn how to use and contribute to the community.
