# OSM Workshops

This is a repository for workshop related information for planning, coordinating, and linking. Each folder contains documents, images, PDFs, and general information on a workshop. Use the wiki for drafts and ideas, move into markdown documents to solidify and archive workshop documentation and materials.

### Long term vision

Longer term vision is that each folder can be a small microsite for a workshop.
